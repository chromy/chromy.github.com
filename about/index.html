Hi! I'm Hector. I spend a lot of my time convincing computers do what I want.
<p>
I graduated in 2015 with a masters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London">Imperial College London</a> in "Computing (Software Engineering)".
I'm a Chromium committer and at the moment I work at Google on Android.
