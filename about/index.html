    Hi! I'm Hector, I spend a lot of my time convincing computers do what I want.
    I'm interested in Python, OpenGL, Interactive Fiction, Non-Interactive fiction,
    embedded systems, distributed systems and similar.
    <p>
    In 2015 I graduated from the masters course at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London">Imperial College London</a>
    with a 1st in "Computing (Software Engineering)".
    Currently I work at Google trying to make the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html">WebView</a> as great as possible.
