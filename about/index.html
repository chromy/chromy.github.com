        I'm Hector.

        <p>
        You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/chromeyhex">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chromea">Instagram</a> and <a href="http://github.com/chromy">GitHub</a>.

        <p>
        In 2015 I started at Google working to make Android Wear the best platform for smart watches.

        <p>
        Before that I studied software engineering at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a>.
        While I was there I interned at Google working on the WebView at the intersection of Google's two largest open-source code bases Android and Chrome.
