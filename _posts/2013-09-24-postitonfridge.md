PostItOnFridge.com
==================

[PostItOnFridge.com](http://postitonfridge.com) was webapp I built with
Xueqi Chen, Kritaphat Songsri-In and Felix de Souza
as part of my second year at university.

From the copy:
"PostItOnFridge.com gives users a shared online space where thay and their friends can post notes, pictures, documents, video and audio. The application uses real-time updates and built-in chat to make the digital space feel like a physical space where you can hang out with your friends."

PostItOnFridge [came in the top 6 out of 38](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computing/teaching/ug/webapps-distinguished-projects/2013) of the \'12/\'13 Web App group projects.
