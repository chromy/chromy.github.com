I took part in [Stoneharth's Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1590639245/stonehearth) 
(which is over now, although you can still preorder it)
because it sounded so cool.
[Stoneharth](http://stonehearth.net/) is a game which kind of looks like a Dwarf Fortress/Minecraft mash up (so you know it's going to be awesome).
Having spent money on it I went into a phase for about a week where I obsessively
read every post the creators had ever made on their devblog and one of the things
I discovered is just how many interesting things they are doing with the tech in the game.

The core engine is written C++ but all of the orchestration happens in  Lua,
they define all of the assets using json and the GUI is rendered on an embedded 
Chrome window layered on top of the game.

That last bit means that they can write the interface as an [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) app getting CSS animations etc. for free which is __really cool__.
The way they've implemented this all (apparently) makes the game really easy to mod[^1] which was one of their design goals.

[^1]: Indeed most of the game's behaviour is implemented as mods through the same API external mods will use.

I was so enamored with their approach that I decided to try and [replicate it](http://github.com/chromy/Fornax).

Notes
-----

Googling around it looks like there are three ways to embed Chrome into a game (without replicating a lot of work):
- [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/)
- [Awesomium](http://awesomium.com/)
- [Berkelium](http://berkelium.org/)

Of these CEF is the most mature (and most complicated) but it was originally designed as a widget to integrate
into a desktop application and the example that ships with it is 12K lines so I have no idea where to start.

In comparison Awesomium is designed for games and the interface is a lot simpler (the minimal example fits on a page) but it's not open source 
(they have a weird "it's free unless you make over $n dollers profit" licence).

Berkelium is an open source clone of an old version of Awesomium which now seems to be suffering pretty badly from bit rot.

The documentation sucks pretty bad for all of them although I would say Awesomium has the edge if just for the nice example.

Stoneharth uses CEF but I just couldn't find a simple example of how to use it anywhere so I ended up using Awesomium.
